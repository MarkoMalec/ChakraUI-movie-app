# ReactJs Movie App

Live demo: https://marko-movie-app.netlify.app

### I have a little roadmap:
  - Under Movie / TV Show: 
      - More information about a screenplay, like budget, popularity etc... (Done for TV shows)
      - Similar Movies / TV Shows based on a current one you're looking at (Done for Movies)
      - User reviews (also Show season ones, although I need to check how far the API can go with this) from TMDB
  - User Athentication
      - register / login
      - Voting
      - Submitting reviews

### CRA was created with ChakraUI template
    - which I kind of regret because I ended up not using it properly thus most of the UI is self made throgh SCSS
